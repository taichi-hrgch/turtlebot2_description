Based on https://github.com/igrak34/turtlebot2-ros2/tree/humble-devel/turtlebot2_description, I changed the position of hokuyo and kinect so that the model was the same as my robot. I also made it possible to specify a prefix to execute.

You can display turtlebot2 on rviz by launching display_with_hokuyo_kinect.launch.py. 

Prefix is "turtlebot/" by default. 
You can change it freely by editing the prefix declaration part of "robots/kobuki_hexagons_kinect_hokuyo.xacro".
TurtleBot2 ROS 2 Description
This repository provides the ROS 2 description for TurtleBot2 with Hokuyo and Kinect sensors. You can visualize the robot in RViz using the provided launch files.

Features
Customizable Sensor Positions: The positions of the Hokuyo and Kinect sensors can be adjusted to match your robot's configuration.

Customizing Sensor Positions
To adjust the positions of the Hokuyo and Kinect sensors, edit the robots/kobuki_hexagons_kinect_hokuyo.xacro file. Modify the transform values to set the desired positions for the sensors.

Changing the Prefix

Replace robot_description.launch.py with the appropriate launch file as needed.

Troubleshooting
If you encounter issues with the visualization or sensor configuration, verify the positions and prefix in the robots/kobuki_hexagons_kinect_hokuyo.xacro file. Ensure all dependencies are correctly installed and sourced.
